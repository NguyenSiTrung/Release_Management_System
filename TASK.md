# NMT Release Management System - Task Tracker

Last Updated: 2025-06-06

## 🎉 Project Status: PRODUCTION READY - ALL MODULES COMPLETE với Enhanced Analytics

**The NMT Release Management System has achieved enhanced production-ready status with all 7 major modules implemented, including enhanced SQE Results Module with intelligent Critical Issues logic, and all technical issues resolved.**

## 🔄 Current Tasks (Maintenance & Minor Issues)

### File Management & Cleanup
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup of temporary folders when evaluation jobs are deleted:
  - [ ] Delete `evaluation_temp/evaluation_{id}` folders automatically
  - [ ] Delete `eval_temp/eval_{id}` folders after evaluation completion
  - [ ] Add unit tests for cleanup functionality
  - [ ] Create automated cleanup script for orphaned temporary files

### Documentation & Training
- [ ] Create comprehensive user manual with screenshots
- [ ] Develop video tutorials for key workflows
- [ ] Document deployment procedures for different environments
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues

### UI/UX Fixes
- [x] **FIXED (2025-06-06 12:07)**: File Content Editor scroll issue in Testset dialog
  - **Issue**: Content in edit mode dialog popup was hidden below footer during scroll
  - **Solution**: Enhanced dialog layout with proper flex structure and overflow handling
  - **Changes**: Updated DialogContent overflow, TextField height management, and z-index positioning

- [x] **IMPROVED (2025-06-06 14:02)**: Dashboard statistics calculations replaced fake data with real metrics
  - **Issue**: Dashboard cards were showing hard-coded fake percentage values instead of calculated metrics
  - **Solution**: Implemented real-time calculation logic for all growth percentages
  - **Changes**: Added growth calculation functions, updated StatCard props, and chart percentage logic
  - **Improvements**: 
    - Language Pairs: Now shows coverage status ("Well covered", "Active", "Need models")
    - Recent Releases: Shows actual month-over-month growth percentage
    - Models Chart: Displays year-over-year growth percentage
    - All metrics now dynamically calculated from actual data

- [x] **FIXED (2025-06-06 14:18)**: Incorrect "35 Active Evaluations" count on Dashboard
  - **Issue**: Dashboard showed 35 active evaluations while database had only 9 jobs with none active
  - **Root Cause**: API was counting temp directories instead of checking actual job status in database
  - **Solution**: 
    - Updated `/evaluations/active` and `/system/status` endpoints to query database for actual active jobs
    - Created cleanup script (`cleanup_temp_evaluations.py`) to remove orphaned temp evaluation directories
    - Cleaned up 35 stale temp directories (35 deleted, 0 kept, 0 errors)
  - **Result**: Dashboard now shows accurate count of truly active evaluations based on database status

### Minor Enhancements
- [ ] Add export functionality for evaluation results (CSV, Excel)
- [ ] Implement batch delete operations for model versions
- [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- [ ] Enhance search functionality with advanced filters

## ✅ **Latest Completed Enhancements (06/06/2025)**

  - **Result**: Critical Issues now accurately reflect Language Pair status based on latest test results

- [x] **Critical Issues Card UI Enhancement**: 
  - **Issue**: Card showed percentage format like "+0.0% of pairs" which was not meaningful
  - **Enhancement**: Replaced with meaningful status messages
  - **New Logic**:
    * `0 issues`: "All systems clear" (Green)
    * `1 issue`: "Requires attention" (Red)
    * `2-3 issues`: "Multiple issues found" (Red)

  - **Files Modified**:
    - `frontend/src/components/common/StatCard.tsx` - Added `noIconShadow` prop
    - `frontend/src/pages/SQEResults.tsx` - Applied `noIconShadow={true}` to Critical Issues card
  - **Result**: Clean, professional icon appearance matching other cards

- [x] **Enhanced Gradient Colors for Critical Issues Card**:
  - **Issue**: Card used gradient with white color causing icon to appear faded
  - **Enhancement**: Implemented dynamic gradient colors based on critical issues status
  - **Logic**: 
    * No issues: Green gradient `['#4caf50', '#66bb6a']`
    * Has issues: Red gradient `['#f44336', '#ef5350']`
  - **Files Modified**: `frontend/src/pages/SQEResults.tsx` - Updated gradientColors logic

## 🧹 Administrative Operations

### Temporary File Cleanup (Added 06/01/2025)

**Issue**: Dashboard was showing incorrect "35 Active Evaluations" when there were actually 0 active jobs.

**Root Cause**: Temp directories in `storage/temp/evaluation_temp/` were not being cleaned up after evaluation jobs completed.

**Solution**: Enhanced cleanup script with safety features:

#### Key Features:
- **Manual operation only**: Script should NEVER run automatically as users may still need access to translation output files
- **Age-based cleanup**: Only deletes directories older than specified days (default: 7 days)
- **Active job protection**: Never deletes directories for running jobs
- **Recent completion protection**: Keeps directories for recently completed jobs
- **Dry run mode**: Default mode shows what would be deleted without actually deleting
- **User confirmation**: Requires manual confirmation before deleting files

#### Usage:
```bash
# Safe preview (default)
python cleanup_temp_evaluations.py --dry-run --days-old 14

# Actually delete files (with confirmation)
python cleanup_temp_evaluations.py --live --days-old 14
```

#### Files Created:
- `backend/cleanup_temp_evaluations.py` - Enhanced cleanup script with safety features
- `backend/CLEANUP_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive admin guide

**Important**: This addresses the dashboard accuracy issue while prioritizing user data safety over automatic cleanup.

## 📋 ActivityTable Enhancements (Added 06/01/2025)

**Enhancement**: Enhanced ActivityTable component with comprehensive filtering, sorting, and export capabilities.
